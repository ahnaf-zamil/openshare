# OpenShare

A platform to share just about anything you want. Your life events, global news, events, your pet goldfish, anything.

No restrictions. No shadow bans. No suppression of free speech.

Of course, there will be filtering to ensure inappropriate content won't be shown to those who don't want it (especially under 18 people).

## License

I spent a lot of time working on stuff like this, especially with my busy schedule as a student. So I don't want anyone to steal my code and claim it to be their own work. Feel free to take inspiration, but don't copy it. If you do, at least credit me in a way people can easily see. Check [LICENSE](LICENSE.md).
